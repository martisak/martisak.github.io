Sometimes, when I come across a Powerpoint presentation with multiple multi-slice pie charts on a single slide my head hurts and I have to go air-poop for half-an-hour. Now I have decided to take action!

# Introducing The F Pie Initiative

I am proud to present an initiative to end bad pie charts. Not all pie charts, just the bad ones.. which is most of them. Members in this elite club pledge to only make beatiful, easily interpretable graphs.

## So what's wrong with pie charts?

"Tables are clearly the best way to show exact numerical values,
although the entries can also be arranged in semi-graphical form.
Tables are preferable to graphics for many small data sets. **A
table is nearly always better than a dumb pie chart; the only
worse design than a pie chart is several of them**, for then the
viewer is asked to compare quantities located in spatial disarray
both within and between pies, as in this heavily encoded example
from an atlas. Given their low data-density and failure to order
numbers along a visual dimension, pie charts should never be used."

- Eward Tufte in *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, pg. 178

"Here sits the friendly pie chart. Its slices are upturned into an inviting smile. Its simple charm is beloved by all but a few,
welcomed almost everywhere; familiar and rarely threatening. Of all the graphs that play
major roles in the lexicon of quantitative communication, however, the pie chart is by far the
least effective. **Its colorful voice is often heard, but rarely understood. It mumbles when it
talks.**"

- Stephen Few in "[Save the Pies for Dessert](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/save_the_pies_for_dessert.pdf)"

## Is there anything good about pie charts?

So can the pie chart be used for anything? Sure, pie charts can be effective in showing the â€œpart-to-whole relationship" (see "[Save the Pies for Dessert](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/save_the_pies_for_dessert.pdf)" ), but the problem is that this is not how they are used.
