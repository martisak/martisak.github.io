Sometimes, when I come across a Powerpoint presentation with multiple multi-slice pie charts on a single slide my head hurts and I have to go air-poop for half-an-hour.



# Introducing The F Pie Initiative

I am proud to present an intiative to end bad pie charts. Not all pie charts, just the bad ones.. which is most of them. Members in this elite club pledge to only make beatiful, easily interpretable graphs.

## So what's wrong with pie charts?

"Tables are clearly the best way to show exact numerical values,
although the entries can also be arranged in semi-graphical form.
Tables are preferable to graphics for many small data sets. **A
table is nearly always better than a dumb pie chart; the only
worse design than a pie chart is several of them**, for then the
viewer is asked to compare quantities located in spatial disarray
both within and between pies, as in this heavily encoded example
from an atlas. Given their low data-density and failure to order
numbers along a visual dimension, pie charts should never be used."
