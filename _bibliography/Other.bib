abstract = {Not long ago I received an email from a colleague who keeps watch on business intelligence vendors and rates their products. She was puzzled that a particular product that I happen to like did not support pie charts, a feature that she assumed was basic and indispensable. Be-cause of previous discussions between us, when I pointed out ineffective graphing practices that are popular in many BI products, she wondered if there might also be a problem with pie charts. Could this vendor's omission of pie charts be intentional and justifi ed? I explained that this was indeed the case, and praised the vendor's design team for their good sense. Here sits the friendly pie chart: Its slices are upturned into an inviting smile. Its simple charm is beloved by all but a few, welcomed almost everywhere; familiar and rarely threatening. Of all the graphs that play major roles in the lexicon of quantitative communication, however, the pie chart is by far the least effective. Its colorful voice is often heard, but rarely understood. It mumbles when it talks. Nothing in the graph design course that I teach is more controversial than what I say about pie charts. People love them dearly and are often shocked to hear me speak ill of them. When students in my course don't raise objections immediately, despite the shock on their faces, they often approach me during a break to defend their frequent use of pies. Many, I suspect, respond this way because they can't imagine how they could possibly convince people where they work to abandon their beloved pies.},
